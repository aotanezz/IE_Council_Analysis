# The Politics of Warehousing in the Inland Empire, CA: How did we get here?
## By: Alyson Otañez

## Background
The Inland Empire (IE) is located in Southern California, east of Los Angeles, made up of the San Bernardino and Riverside counties. It has seen rapid economic and industrial growth as a result of the increased demand in e-commerce and fast delivery, which has led to decreased air quality, loss of green space, and health impacts to the region. Warehouse development and placement is an environmental injustice issue; over 300,000 individuals live within ¼ mile of a warehouse, ~60% are Hispanic or Latino. San Bernardino and Riverside are the top 2 counties in the United States, where over a third of their year is met with high concentrations of ozone.

The approval of new warehouses is decided at the local level. My research focuses on Ontario, Fontana, Rialto, Chino, and the March Joint Powers Authority who are the regions with the highest concentration of warehouses in the IE. My project seeks to understand conversations occurring at the local level, as if this a relatively understudied issue, with little understanding of its causes and effects. To understand the dynamic between warehousing and local governments, I chose to analyze the city council agenda/meeting minutes of the cities of interest.
